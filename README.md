# garbage collector
garbage collector is a userbot that aims to automate interacting with cat bot

# i am not responsible for any accounts banned as selfbots are against discord tos but i guess nobody cares
anyways

## setting up
1. first you need to get the token of the account you're gonna use (i recomend making an alt)
* since im too lazy to explain just look at [this page](https://discordpy-self.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authenticating.html)
2. create a file called collectorToken.txt and put the token in there
3. if you didn't install the dependencies do it now
